# Name App
The Name App is a web application providing access to a list of names and their amounts in an organization, stored on a server.

The Name App uses Node.js with Express on the back-end (running in port 5000), and React on the front-end (running in port 3000), with the front-end talking to the back-end via an API. To run the application locally, Node.js needs to be installed.

To run the application, run the the following command in the root of the project:

`npm install && npm install --prefix client`

Then, run the following command in the root of the project:

`npm run dev`

After start up, the application is available at http://localhost:3000
